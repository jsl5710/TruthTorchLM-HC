"""Intervention & routing action space (protocol Q6).

The Intervention & Routing Engine is the consumer of everything the benchmark measures: it
maps the combined signals — UQ score (M), the OOD/competence gate, risk flags, and the
grounding result — to *what to do next* with a candidate response. This module defines the
**action space** it selects over; the policy that does the selecting (a rule-based MVP
first, a learned MoE later) is built on top.

The space is **two-level**: three primary decisions, and — because "don't ship this
answer" can be resolved several ways — an `abstain` primary fans out into a **handoff**.

Primary actions:

    APPROVE   deliver the response to the user as-is
    CLARIFY   rewrite the message / ask the user to resolve an ambiguity (a loop, not a ship)
    ABSTAIN   do not ship this answer; then pick a handoff ↓

Abstain handoffs (how the abstention is resolved):

    RAG                  retrieve grounding context and regenerate, then re-gate
    ESCALATE_LARGER_LLM  hand off to a larger / reasoning model
    ESCALATE_HUMAN       human-in-the-loop review (highest cost)
    (none)               plain safe refusal — decline with no downstream

Every decision carries a **cost tier**, because the protocol frames the router as an
accuracy–safety–cost trade, not a plain classifier: escalating to a larger model or a
human is expensive, so the objective is the *cheapest adequate* decision — approve when
safe, reach for an expensive handoff only when the signals demand it. `is_safe_stop` marks
the decisions that never ship an unreviewed answer.
