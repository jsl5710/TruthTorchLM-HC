"""Stage B -- correctness labels (protocol §3, §7).

Annotate each primary answer with a binary reliable/unreliable label -- the ground truth
the UQ score is graded against. The protocol is emphatic that this choice is not
incidental: "the correctness criterion materially moves AUROC" because it *defines the
labels*. So Stage B runs **both** criteria and persists both, and Stage D reports AUROC
sensitivity across them rather than either silently picking one.

* ``llm_judge`` -- TruthTorchLM's ``ModelJudge`` (LLM-as-judge). For health, hand it a
  clinical rubric via ``judge_system_prompt`` and spot-validate against a human.
* ``bleurt`` -- BLEURT-20 similarity thresholded at 0.5, matching DisAAD's ``--thres_gt
  0.5`` so our biomedical numbers line up with theirs.

Labels are keyed by criterion, e.g. ``correct_llm_judge`` / ``correct_bleurt``, and
written back next to the cache.
