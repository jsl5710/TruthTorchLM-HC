"""Wall-clock stage timing for UQ methods (benchmark protocol §5).

Upstream TruthTorchLM scores truth values but times nothing, so the entire latency layer
is new. The protocol's central claim is that "single-pass < multi-sample" is the *coarse*
story and hides the two things that actually decide deployability: whether a method fits
an absolute real-time budget, and whether concurrency collapses or leaves the N× penalty
intact. Both require measured milliseconds.

Design constraints this module is built around:

**Three stages, timed separately.** Total per-estimate latency decomposes into

    target generation  +  extra generations  +  auxiliary compute

Target generation is the answer the user gets anyway, so it is measured but *excluded*
from marginal latency. Extra generations (multi-sample draws, chain-of-interaction turns)
are the dominant marginal term and scale with the generator. Auxiliary compute (NLI
clustering, embedding, proxy forward pass) is the query-independent floor. Collapsing
these into one number would make the generator×family matrix in §5 unreadable.

**Off by default, and genuinely off.** When disabled, ``stage()`` returns a shared null
context manager: no clock reads, no allocation, no dict writes. Upstream behaviour has to
be bit-identical when the benchmark is not running, or the fork stops being a safe base
to merge upstream changes into.

**Context-local, not global.** Records live in a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar`, so
concurrent API sampling (``instrumentation.concurrency``) and threaded harness runs
accumulate into the right record instead of racing on one.
